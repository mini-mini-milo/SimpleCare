This is only a summary. For more information about your coverage, or to get a copy of the complete terms of coverage, go to www.kp.org/plandocuments
or by calling 1-800-290-8900. For general definitions of common terms, such as allowed amount, balance billing, coinsurance, copayment, deductible, provider, or

Important Questions

Answers

Why This Matters:
Generally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the deductible amount
before this plan begins to pay. If you have other Family members on the plan, each
Family member must meet their own Individual deductible until the total amount of
deductible expenses paid by all Family members meets the overall Family deductible.
This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the deductible
amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers
certain preventive services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible.
See a list of covered preventive services at www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventivecare-benefits.

What is the overall
deductible?

$5,500 Individual / $11,000 Family

Are there services
covered before you meet
your deductible?

Yes. Preventive care and services indicated
in chart starting on page 2.

Are there other
deductibles for specific
services?

No.

You don’t have to meet deductibles for specific services.

What is the out-of-pocket
limit for this plan?

$7,150 Individual / $14,300 Family

What is not included in
the out-of-pocket limit?

Premiums, balance-billed charges and health
care this plan doesn’t cover.

The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services. If you
have other Family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of-pocket
limits until the overall Family out-of-pocket limit has been met.

Will you pay less if you
use a network provider?

Yes. See www.kp.org/wa or call 1-800-2908900 for a list of network providers.

Do you need a referral to
see a specialist?

Yes, but you may self-refer to certain
specialists.

Even though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit.
This plan uses a provider network. You will pay less if you use a provider in the plan’s
network. You will pay the most if you use an out-of-network provider, and you might
receive a bill from a provider for the difference between the provider’s charge and
what your plan pays (balance billing). Be aware, your network provider might use an
out-of-network provider for some services (such as lab work). Check with your
provider before you get services.
This plan will pay some or all of the costs to see a specialist for covered services but
only if you have a referral before you see the specialist.
